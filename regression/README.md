# 📘 Regularized Regression

This folder contains a comprehensive notebook demonstrating **Linear Regression** and its regularized variants:
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **ElasticNet Regression**

All models are implemented from scratch using `scikit-learn` and compared using a common dataset.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Linear Regression** | Standard regression without regularization |
| **Ridge Regression** | L2 regularization to penalize large coefficients |
| **Lasso Regression** | L1 regularization to perform feature selection |
| **ElasticNet** | Combines L1 and L2 regularization for balance |

## 🔍 Workflow

- 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ⚙️ Feature Scaling  
- ✨ Model Training & Evaluation (with train-test split)  
- 📈 Coefficient Analysis & Regularization Effects  
- 📉 RMSE and R² score comparison across models  
- 🔎 VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to check multicollinearity
